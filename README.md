##  Literature research


The framework is based on the article published in 2013, Stephanie and Chris focus on two main concepts that work from models of cognition to support meaningful data visualizations— simplification and emphasis. [@Steph]

}

```
Simplification helps readers focus on the data, for color, it means the number of the color should be simplified. Instead of using different colors, secondary information or data points should be simplified to a shade of gray so that chosen elements can appropriately stand out[@Steph].The same with shape and texture, a good visualization work won’t use too much chart junk or add unnecessary charts[@Emma].And space should be distributed evenly[@Anderson].

```

A simplify visualization should fit one page for better reading and fit for a mobile device as well, because of the popularity of smartphone[@Mico].

```

The second key criteria is emphasis. It also includes two metrics: Basic Design and Movement. In basic design metrics, the color should be chosen wisely. For example, yellow is a good example of a popular color choice when a designer needs to call attention to a specific area. However, certain color combinations, such as red–green or blue– yellow, cause difficulty for people with color blindness and should generally be avoided[@Evergreen]; And data-ink ratio, data-density was called by Tufte[@Tufte] Weight requests your visualization have difference in weight ratio, such as changing the size of some points in a scatter plot. The movement includes story line and animation/filters, they are good practices to draw the reader’s attention.

```

My framework is based on this article from Stephanie and Chris. And considering the important role that communication plays in visualization, I also included it to the key criteria. In Jennifer’s blog(2018)[@Jennifer], the three questions below have been raised:

1.	What is the goal of the document?
2.	Who is the audience?
3.	What are the most effective ways to display and group the data?

```
@misc{Jennifer,
  author = {{Jennifer Bellville}},

  title = {Blog: Summarizing Project Milestones},
  howpublished = {\url{http://www.evalu-ate.org/blog/bellville_mar18/}},

}

```

The goal for visualization accurately show the data without misrepresenting. This is very essential for communication. And you should choose the best chart to reach this goal. (Emma Perk & Lyssa Wilson Becho, 2019). And your visualization should be audience-friendly, which means it is easy understanding and specific to your audience[@Emma]. 

## The framework

Key Criteria | Metrics | Description | Max Points

Emplasis | Basic Design | Color choice(1), weight(1), data-ink ratio(1), data-density(1) | 4
--- | Movement | Story line(1), animation/filters(1) | 2
 Communication | Goal | Accurately show the data(2); Choose the best chart(2) | 4
--- | Audience | Involved-- Specific to your audience(1);Easy understanding(1) |2
